```
Q 1. What is React?
Ans:React is an open-source JavaScript library for
building user interfaces or UI components,
developed by Facebook.
```

```
Q 2. Explain JSX
Ans: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for
JavaScript recommended by React for describing
what the UI should look like.
```

```
Q 3. What is the virtual DOM?
Ans:The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual
DOM in memory. React uses it to improve
performance by updating only the changed parts of
the actual DOM.
```

```
Q 4. What is the significance of keys in React?
Ans:Keys are used to uniquely identify and differentiate
between components in React. They help React
identify which items have changed, added, or
removed.
```

```
Q 5. What are state and props in React?
Ans:State is an internal data store that belongs to a
specific component, and it can be changed over
time. Props are properties passed to a component
from its parent, and they are immutable.
```

```
Q 6. What is the difference between state and props?
Ans:State is internal to a component and can be changed
over time, while props are external and passed to a
component.
```

```
Q 7. Explain the concept of lifting state up.
Ans:Lifting state up is a pattern where the state of a child
component is moved to its parent component,
allowing multiple child components to share the
same state.
```

```
Q 8. What is the purpose of setState in React?
Ans:setState is used to update the state of a component
and trigger a re-render.
```

``
Q 9. What is React Router?
Ans:React Router is a library that enables navigation
among views in a React application, allowing for the
development of single-page applications.
```

```
Q 10. Explain the useEffect hook.
Ans:The useEffect hook in React is used for side effects in
functional components, such as data fetching,
subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
```

```
Q 11. What are controlled components in React?
Ans:Controlled components are components where the
form data is controlled by React state. The input
elements receive their current value from the state
and have their value updated through a callback
function.
```

```
Q 12. What is Redux, and why is it used?
Ans:Redux is a state management library for JavaScript
applications, commonly used with React. It helps
manage the state of an application in a predictable
way.
```

```
Q 13. Explain the concept of higher-order
components (HOC).
Ans:Higher-order components are functions that take a
component and return a new component with
additional features or props.
```

```
Q 14. What is the purpose of the useReducer hook?
Ans:The useReducer hook is used for managing complex
state logic in React applications. It is an alternative
to useState when state transitions are more
complex.
```

```
Q 15. What is the significance of the key attribute
in React lists?
Ans:The key attribute is used to uniquely identify
elements in a list. It helps React efficiently update
the DOM when the list changes.
```


```
Q 16. What is the difference between class
components and functional components?
Ans:class components use ES6 classes and have
additional features like state and lifecycle methods,
while functional components are simpler and are
often used with hooks.
```

````
Q 17. Explain the concept of refs in React.
Ans:Refs are used to access the DOM directly or to
reference a React element. They provide a way to
interact with the underlying DOM nodes in React.
```

```
Q 18. What are React hooks?
Ans:React hooks are functions that allow functional
components to use state, lifecycle methods, and
other React features.
```

```
Q 19. Explain the purpose of the useContext
hook.
Ans:The useContext hook is used to access the value of a
React context within a functional component.
```

```
Q 20. What is the significance of the
dangerouslySetInnerHTML property in React?
Ans:dangerouslySetInnerHTML is used to inject HTML
directly into a component, but it should be used with
caution to avoid cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities.
